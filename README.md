# Education personalization
Creating a free system for learning. Database with educational materials sorted by their scope, content, language, format, type, source. Making Wikipedia outdated in learning by suggesting a list of study materials to each topic for the User to choose best fitting (e.g. as 10 y.o.).

### Introduction
* **Finding educational materials** - searching for the right educational materials (eg. answer to a question) often takes more time than reading/understanding the answer
* **Understanding what you are learning** - lots of answers and knowledge are delivered using words that are only understandable to experts. It is crucial to get the article written in the language you know (e.g. as a 5-years-old kid)
* **Remembering** - learning without repetitions and exercises is difficult, as itâ€™s often impossible to learn everything you want to at first
* **Misinformation** - loads of articles, not only about current events (fake news), are published without proper sources, which makes them unreliable: most of them are not true not because someone wants to lie, but because Author believes in what he is spreading. Confirmation is necessary to get proper information and truth.
* **Intellectual Property** - Many tutors do not attach visualizations to their presentations afraid of violating the law

## To do
The goal of this system is to make learning easier by providing Users with a variety of educational materials that they can sort and filter. Creating this software will surely convince Universities, Schools, and other Organizations to maintain this initiative on their servers making this portal free-of-costs to Users. The biggest challenge is filling the database with articles, presentations, memory games, etc., but this, creating a worldwide web library, is going to happen in the future anyway, so we should start developing it.

##### Scope and requirements:
* Creating Internet Library software
* accessible to anyone for free
* maintained on academic servers
* moderated by volunteers

##### Products
* **Database** - facilitator of educational materials, where each record (edu material) can be tagged by users according to its content, scope, language, covered information, required knowledge to understand, type, etc.
* **Games for remembering** - Creating open-source games for learning so that anyone could play with publicly available or their own sets.
* **Lectures generator** - Select what would you like to learn, on which level of details, what is your current knowledge, to get a personalized set consisting of various educational materials covering the subject you want to learn.
